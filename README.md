### Apps

The current (legacy) apps are not included in this repository. Visit these repositories:

- [DDSE 2](https://github.com/NoahStolk/DevilDaggersSurvivalEditor)
- [DDCL 1](https://github.com/NoahStolk/DevilDaggersCustomLeaderboards)
- [DDAE 1](https://github.com/NoahStolk/DevilDaggersAssetEditor)

The project aims to be a fully cross-platform monorepo. The current apps do not fit in this architecture and porting them is not worth the effort. They're also pretty old and only work on Windows. New cross-platform apps are in development and will be announced in the future.
